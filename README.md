### What is EFFB:

EFFB offers a solution that utilizes Web3 technology to achieve **AI**, **socialization**, and **enhanced user engagement**, promoting **environmental protection** in a form that particularly attracts early adopters, social players, and blockchain technology supporters.

In short, EFFB is a Web3-based reward social discovery protocol aimed at equally benefiting users and the public interest.

It leverages blockchain technology to enable users to transform their digital footprints and engagement into a collaborative force for promoting the public good. For example, users can earn environmental funds by posting environmental promotional content on the app and can win environmental funds by participating in various environmental activities, with the environmental funds shared by winners and environmental organizations.

This is a new way of social change utilizing blockchain technology's community-driven force, combining the sense of winning rewards with the power of pooling donations, thereby achieving societal change.

# Overview of Social Industry Development

With the development of Web3 technology and infrastructure, the social track has also ushered in new opportunities. Anonymity, censorship resistance, user ownership of data, and other factors attract users and developers to explore new social tools. The current Web3 social track has attracted the participation of some developers and capital, with hundreds of projects in the social ecosystem, including social chains, social graphs, social identities, various types of social applications, service tools, etc., attracting a large number of users and market attention.

# Characteristics of Social Track

```For Web3 social, there is currently no unified definition. We can classify all products involving information dissemination, exchange, and user portrayal into the field of socialization. From the current development achievements, it mainly includes social public chains, social graphs, social identities, various types of social applications, service tools, etc.```

### Key factors driving the development of Web3 social:

#### 1. Anonymity, censorship resistance

Compared to Web2 social, one of the biggest advantages of Web3 social is anonymity and censorship resistance, a feature that has already been verified as one of the user's demands at present.
Decentralized Web3 inherently has the characteristics of protecting user privacy and resisting centralized institutional censorship. These characteristics can meet the user's demands for protecting privacy and maintaining their own security.

#### 2. User ownership of data

In the Web3 field, user ownership of data can be realized to obtain the commercial value of data traffic for users. From the user's perspective, projects that enable users to conveniently realize the commercial value realization of data have a certain appeal.
In Web3, due to the diversity of tokens, the volatility of token value, and the richness of token economic design, the commercial value realization of data ownership can derive many interesting gameplay methods that attract users, which may even exceed the wealth creation effect and new user effect created by the previous round of chain game bull market.

#### 3. Composability

An ideal Web3 social product may have the opportunity to solve the problem of data silos, similar to attempts to depict user profiles such as POAP and ENS. In the future, simpler and more accessible standard protocols may appear to help users conveniently grasp data ownership while being compatible with access to most protocols.

# Current Challenges

How to introduce a large number of users is the biggest challenge and opportunity for Web3 social projects. One of the important reasons limiting the development of the encryption field is that the user base is too small,
First, there is a certain learning curve for users to enter the encryption field. Users need to master certain computer and encryption knowledge to participate in on-chain interactions,
Second, compared to Web2 user tools, current encryption projects are more complex and less simple and convenient to use.
For example, taking the EOA wallet as an example, the complex mnemonic and storage methods, potential phishing and theft of private keys, software update iterations, and compatibility issues between software all affect the user experience. Keeping a large number of Web2 users out of the encrypted world, relatively, this also means that once the problem of learning costs and entry barriers is solved, once there is a social project that is easy to use and allows users to operate without feeling, it will bring huge user traffic.

# User Acquisition Methods

### 1. Social Media
Spread the importance of environmental protection and the value of the platform through social media platforms (such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, etc.) and Eco Friendly Floating Bottle, and attract more users to participate through **token airdrops**.
### 2. Collaboration and Educational Guidance
Collaborate with various environmental organizations, schools, and companies to jointly promote environmental protection and attract their members to participate in the platform.

# Eco Friendly Floating Bottle Gameplay

### 1. Drifting Bottle Release

    1. Tags
      By publishing drifting bottle content with tags such as environmental, wind power, and new energy, users can earn a certain amount of environmental funds based on the weather in their area. If the weather is sunny, they will receive more rewards, while if the weather is severe (PM2.5 content is too high), they will not receive rewards, encouraging global participation in environmental actions to improve the environment around them.
    2. Rare Wildlife NFT
      By releasing drifting bottles, there is a chance to draw world-class rare wildlife NFTs, both rare and common NTFs.
    3. Collect Environmental Ideas
      Through a module in the drifting bottle, publicize the collection of environmental ideas. When a certain exposure is reached, promote this idea through the form of DAO organization and vote. The proposer of this idea will receive a large amount of environmental fund rewards and have the opportunity to receive official public investment promotion.
    4. Weekly Small Goals
      Within each cycle (Monday to Sunday), if the like rate of a single drifting bottle reaches 4%, and the pick-up rate within 7 days of publication reaches 5000/10000/50000/100000/5000000, participants can get 2/3/6/8/15 times the multiplier to share a 1 million environmental fund prize pool.
    5. Monthly Fan Growth Competition
      Within each cycle (from the 1st to the end of the month), by achieving a certain number of fan growth increments, participants can share a 2 million environmental fund prize pool.
    6. Posting Frequency
      Within each cycle (Monday to Sunday), if you achieve daily check-ins and post at least three days a week, you can share a 500,000 environmental fund prize pool.
    7. Environmental Classroom Incentive Plan
      Publish environmental courses on the platform and offer free previews to give a certain amount of environmental fund rewards.

### 2. Environmental Volunteer Activities
Organize some environmental activities publicly, and participation in environmental volunteer activities will be included in the reward system. In addition to rewards for environmental promotional content, more actual environmental behaviors will be added as conditions for user participation, such as participating in environmental volunteer activities, saving energy, and reducing waste.

### 3. AI-Generated Environmental Propaganda Release
Through AI (text/pictures/videos/sounds, etc.), automatically generate drifting bottle propaganda on environmental concepts, encourage users to save energy, reduce waste generation in daily life, cultivate environmental habits, and contribute to environmental protection.

### 4. Policy Overview
Through participating in environmental drifting bottle activities, users can scan the QR code on the drifting bottle to learn about environmental issues and understand the attention paid by governments around the world to environmental causes and the formulation and implementation of environmental protection laws and regulations.

# Imagination

AI integrates global environmental promotion and socialization, integrating massive environmental concepts into the evolving story of the world. By allowing users to publish environmental ideas or stories to enhance their awareness and change regarding environmental protection. **Through the weather in the user's area**, rewards will be given to the authors. There will be more gameplay: such as **collecting environmental ideas, like rates, follower counts, posting frequencies**, and other environmental activities waiting for everyone to participate in.

One unique aspect of EFFB is its commitment to environmental protection - it is the first Web3 reward social network designed specifically for users and the public interest.

```This model combines charitable donations with personal income, harmoniously coordinating these two aspects to ensure that EFFB players are not only driven by their own interests but also consistent with the broader goals of supporting Earth's environmental protection.```

```For every reward issued to users on the platform, an equal donation will be made to organizations dedicated to environmental protection. This "dual incentive" model ensures that user participation not only brings personal rewards but also contributes to larger goals consistent with the community. The platform promises to match rewards with conservation efforts, effectively transforming daily online activities (such as posting drifting bottles) into effortless environmental actions.```

The health of the Earth is one of the most urgent and important challenges of our time, crucial not only for the protection of nature but also for ensuring the sustainable future of all species, including humans. Young native users of cryptography often consider saving the Earth to be one of the most important issues of our time, so by utilizing digital participation to promote environmental protection, EFFB demonstrates a model of how technology and Web3 innovation can support sustainability and environmental protection goals.

This innovation aims to cultivate community awareness and common goals among users, who can see the direct impact of their actions on the Earth.

EFFB pledges support for four verified environmental organizations: **Ocean Cleanup Organization, International Union for Conservation of Nature, Nature Conservancy, and Argentine Wildlife Foundation**.
